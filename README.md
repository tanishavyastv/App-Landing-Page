# App Landing Page

## Description

This is a landing page for the UIFry financial application. The design is focused on providing a clean and modern interface that highlights the application's key features, advantages, and user testimonials. The page includes sections such as navigation, features, advantages, testimonials, FAQs, and a call-to-action footer.

## Design Choices

- **Font Styles:** The entire page is styled using the 'Segoe UI' font family to maintain a consistent and modern look. Various font weights are used to emphasize different elements.
- **Layout and Spacing:** Flexbox is extensively utilized for layout management, ensuring elements are properly aligned and spaced. Margins are adjusted to provide adequate spacing between elements and maintain visual hierarchy.
- **Color Scheme:** The color scheme primarily consists of black and white, with 'orangered' highlights for emphasis.
- **Icons and Images:** Background images are used for the body and specific sections to add visual interest.
- **Buttons and Links:** Buttons are styled with a black background, white text, and rounded borders to make them stand out. Links have black text color and are styled to remove the default underline.
- **Hover Effects:** Buttons and certain images have hover effects applied to provide visual feedback to users, such as scaling up and adding shadows.
- **Containers and Sections:** Containers are used to group elements and ensure proper alignment. Sections are styled with flexbox to maintain consistent spacing between different content sections.
